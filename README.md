- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arxra, generic software university student.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in efficent open source software, where I've currently snowed in on the mountain tops of Rust-mountain and Neovim-mountian.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on Rust, one can never have too much software oxidation as well as studying my masters thesis
in distributed systems @KTH.

- Most of my projects are over at https://gitlab.com/arxra, such as my neovim-configuration and website projects. Most things here on github are either tracking those, or collaboration.
