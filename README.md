- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arxra, Fresh out of Uni and ready to dev.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in efficent open source software, where I've currently snowed in on the mountain top of Rust.

- Most of my projects are over at https://gitlab.com/arxra, such as my neovim-configuration and website projects. Most things here on github are either tracking those, or collaboration.
