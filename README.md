- 👋 Hi, I’m @arxra, generic software university student.
- 👀 I’m interested in efficent open source software, where I've currently snowed in on the mountain tops of Rust-mountain and Neovim-mountian.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on Rust, one can never have too much software oxidation as well as studying my masters thesis
in distributed systems @KTH.
